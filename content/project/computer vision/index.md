Computer vision (CV) is the science allowing computers and software systems to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. While a wide variety of tasks span from this discipline, they usually all share the general end goal of extracting specific information that will be useful in a broader production process.

For this project, we focused on the object recognition task, which refers to the capability to locate and identify specific objects. For SN Hawaii and Waterman5, we developed a water safety computer vision system, able to locate key entities on live drone footage, such as persons, dangerous currents, surfers and more.
