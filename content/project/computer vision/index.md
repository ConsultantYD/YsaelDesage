Computer vision (CV) is the science allowing computers and software systems to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. While a wide variety of tasks span from this discipline, they usually all share the general end goal of extracting specific information that will be useful in a broader production process. 


For this project, we focused on the object recognition task, which refers to the capability to locate and identify specific objects. With SN Hawaii and Waterman5, we developed a water safety computer vision system, able to locate key entities on live drone footage, such as persons, dangerous currents, surfers and more.

Modern computer vision systems rely almost exclusively on deep neural networks (deep learning), due to their high performance which stems from their inherent capability to learn and generalize well on big datasets. Whereas traditional deep learning systems require millions of identified examples, and heavy computing resources to reach desirable production performance, we avoided these major drawbacks in the present case by using transfer learning. Transfer learning is a research branch of artificial intelligence, which consists in exploiting learned knowledge from an existing system, to apply (transfer) it in a new (connex) setting. 


More specifically, instead of training a brand new model from scratch (which would require many labeled examples), we started from an existing state-of-the-art model that was already trained on a gigantic dataset with specialized distributed hardware acceleration. Our goal was to keep all the cutting edge neural networkâ€™s self-taught treatment and analysis capabilities, but to simply change its end goal to locate our objects instead of the ones it was originally designed to. By doing so, only a handful of annotated images specific to our application, and a little fine-tuning were necessary to achieve the performance shown in the video above. Even better, the training only took a few hours, and was executed on a normal laptop with no GPU or specialized hardware.
