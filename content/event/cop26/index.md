summary: Multi-agent Artificial Intelligence applied to smart building clusters interacting with the electric grid.
abstract: "BrainBox AI is a market leader in the Cleantech and Proptech sectors offering artificial intelligence (AI) to combat climate change by making commercial buildings smarter and more efficient. Its flagship product combines AI and cloud computing to create a fully autonomous commercial heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) solution. Through seamless communication with building management systems (BMS), the technology optimizes HVAC systems in real-time, permitting the existing infrastructure to become predictive and self-adaptive, while significantly reducing energy consumption and emissions. Harnessing the power of BrainBox AIâ€™s core product, its next phase of innovation brings together entire building clusters and cities."
