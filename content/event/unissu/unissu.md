summary: Pre-emptive HVAC optimization using deep learning prediction models.
abstract: "In many cases, HVAC structures are designed as fixed systems or programmed for a fairly static environment, even though factors like weather and occupancy are fluid and dynamic. AI is revolutionizing building management by pivoting to a pre-emptive approach. 

In this session, I discuss with my colleagues BrainBox's end-to-end process overview with a focus on its deep learning prediction model and neural networks."
